📌 Trump Social Network Analysis (SNA)

This repository contains the complete Social Network Analysis (SNA) project on the social connections of Donald J. Trump, exploring influence patterns, structural behavior, and community formation using Python, NetworkX, and Power BI.

🧠 Project Overview

This project performs a deep analysis of Trump’s social connections by applying:

Centrality Metrics

Community Detection Algorithms

Ego Network Visualizations

Structural Properties

The study reveals a hub-and-spoke network, where Donald Trump is the central influencer connected to multiple independent clusters.

⭐ Key Features
Centrality Metrics
